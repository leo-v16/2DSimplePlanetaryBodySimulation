# 2DSimplePlanetaryBodySimulation
simulation of free bodies interacting using simple vector algebra from numpy
the mass, proportions and direction of bodies have not much to do with the real solar system, it's just for fun
add bodies with the array named "bodies" and give them a push using the last parameter of the class Body to see how things goes
